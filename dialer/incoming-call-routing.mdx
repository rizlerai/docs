The Incoming Call Routing system allows you to configure how incoming calls are handled and automatically determines which user should handle each call based on intelligent priority logic.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Users can configure how incoming calls are handled by visiting their Profile Settings:

👉 **Profile Settings**: [https://app.aisync.link.com/profile](https://docs.aisync.link/settings/personal-settings#%E2%98%8E%EF%B8%8F-incoming-call-settings)

In the profile section, users can select one of four incoming call routing options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="RizzDialer" icon="phone">
    Call is routed to the RizzDialer interface for manual handling by the user/agent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Phone (User/Agent Phone Number)" icon="mobile-screen">
    Call is forwarded directly to the user/agent phone number.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI (PowerList AI Agent)" icon="robot">
    Call is automatically routed to a configured AI agent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dialer + AI" icon="phone-arrow-up-right">
    Call first attempts to reach the user/agent. If unavailable, the system transfers the call to an AI agent.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## 🔍 User Identification Logic

Before routing the call based on the selected option, the system determines which user the call belongs to. The system follows this priority order:

### 1️⃣ Priority 1: Recent Calling History

The system checks if any user has recently called this phone number (the incoming caller).

- If a match is found, the most recent caller is selected as the responsible user.
- This ensures continuity in customer relationships.

### 2️⃣ Priority 2: Assigned System Number (DID)

If no recent caller is found:

- The system checks whether the "To" number (the system number receiving the call) is assigned to a specific user.
- If yes, the call is routed under that user.

### 3️⃣ Priority 3: PowerList Assignment

If the system number is not assigned to any user:

- The system checks whether the caller's number exists within any PowerList.
- If the PowerList is assigned to a user, that user is selected.

### 4️⃣ Priority 4: Default to Company User

If none of the above conditions match:

- The system routes the call using the default company user.

<Note>
The system processes these checks in order and stops at the first match, ensuring efficient call routing.
</Note>

## 🤖 AI Agent Selection Logic

After determining the responsible user, the system follows this logic if AI is required (for **AI** or **Dialer + AI** mode):

### 📋 Existing Contact in PowerList

If the incoming caller exists in any PowerList that has an AI agent configured:

➡️ The call is transferred to that specific PowerList's AI agent.

This allows for personalized AI interactions based on the PowerList context.

### ✨ New Contact

If the caller does not exist in any PowerList:

➡️ The system uses the default PowerList's AI agent.

This ensures all calls are handled, even for unknown callers.

<Tip>
Configure AI agents for your PowerLists to provide specialized handling for different customer segments or campaign types.

## 📊 Call Flow Summary

### 👥 User Assignment Flow

```
Incoming Call
   ↓
Check recent user → If found, use that user
   ↓ If not
Check if system number (To) is assigned to a user
   ↓ If not
Check if caller exists in a PowerList with assigned user
   ↓ If not
Default company user
```

### 🤖 AI Routing Flow

```
Incoming Call → AI Needed?
     ↓
Check if contact exists in PowerList
     ├── Yes → Use that PowerList's AI agent
     └── No → Use default PowerList AI agent
```
