**Title**
Enter a unique name for your campaign (e.g., "TEST1"). Use descriptive names to easily identify different campaigns.

**Campaign Type**
Select "Predictive" for automated dialing. This automatically calls multiple numbers and connects answered calls to available agents.

**Agent**
Choose "All" to assign all available agents, or select specific agents. The system distributes calls based on agent availability.

**Powerlist**
Select a contact list from the dropdown. Ensure your powerlist contains valid phone numbers for optimal performance.

**Call Staggering**
Set the interval between calls (default: "1 Second"). This controls call pacing - shorter intervals increase volume, longer intervals give agents more time.

**Voice Templates**
Choose a voice script from the dropdown. Templates ensure consistent messaging during calls.

Click **Submit** to create your campaign.
