## Add Voice Campaig

To create a new predictive dialer campaign, fill out the following form:

https://app.aisync.link.com/manage/voice_campaign

![AI Dashboard Interface](/images/ai/add-voice.png)

**Title**
Enter a unique name for your campaign (e.g., "TEST1"). Use descriptive names to easily identify different campaigns.

**Campaign Type**
Select "Predictive" for automated dialing. This automatically calls multiple numbers and connects answered calls to available agents.

**Agent**
Choose "All" to assign all available agents, or select specific agents. The system distributes calls based on agent availability.

**Powerlist**
Select a contact list from the dropdown. Ensure your powerlist contains valid phone numbers for optimal performance.

**Call Staggering**
Set the interval between calls (default: "1 Second"). This controls call pacing - shorter intervals increase volume, longer intervals give agents more time.

**Voice Templates**
Choose a voice script from the dropdown. Templates ensure consistent messaging during calls.

Click **Submit** to create your campaign.

## üéØ Predictive Dialer + AI Agent Handling
### üîÑ Dialing Behavior:
The system dials 5 numbers at a time using predictive dialing.

When multiple contacts pick up:

Example: 3 people answer, but only 1 human agent is available:

    - ‚úÖ 1 call ‚Üí routed to available human agent

    - ü§ñ 2 remaining calls ‚Üí routed to AI agents

### ‚öôÔ∏è AI Agent Assignment (Per PowerList):
Each PowerList can have a dedicated AI agent assigned.
![AI Agent Assign to PowerList](/images/dialer/predictive/ai-agent-powerlist.png)

This allows dynamic customization of:

    - ü§ù Tone & behavior
    - üìú Script logic
    - üéØ Lead type handling

AI agents act as backups for overflow or after-hours handling.

### üîÅ Callback Handling Logic:
If a contact picks up but drops (due to no human agent available) or misses the call:

That lead is automatically flagged for callback.

The PowerList-assigned AI agent will:

    - Re-engage the lead via automated callback
    - Attempt to qualify, reschedule, or book appointment directly
