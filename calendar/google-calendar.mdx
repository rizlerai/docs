## 🤖 AI Join Feature

The integration includes an AI Join capability that allows AI agents to participate in meetings:
- Shows "AI Join: No Permission (Locked)" for calendars where the feature is disabled
- Enables automated meeting participation when permissions are granted
- Supports multiple calendar subscriptions (e.g., "Holidays in Pakistan")

> **Premium Feature**: AI Join is a premium feature that requires a subscription. If you want to enable AI agents to automatically join your meetings, you'll need to subscribe to access this functionality.
