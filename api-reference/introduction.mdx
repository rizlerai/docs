## 🚀 What is OAuth?

OAuth is a secure way to let your application access user data without asking for their password. Think of it like giving a hotel key card - you get access to specific rooms (permissions) without sharing your master key (password).

### 🏗️ Step 1: Create Your OAuth Client

Before you can use OAuth, you need to create an OAuth client in your dashboard. This gives you the credentials needed to authenticate.

1. Go to **OAuth Client Management (Advanced)** in your dashboard
2. Click the **"Create New OAuth Client"** button
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **Client Name**: Give your application a descriptive name (e.g., "My Application")
   - **Redirect URI**: Where users will be sent after they authorize your app (e.g., `https://app.aisync.link/test/callback`)
   - **Confidential Client**: Check this box if your app can securely store secrets (recommended for server-side apps)
4. Click **"Create Client"**

<Note>
The Redirect URI must exactly match what you use in your authorization requests. Make sure it's the full URL including the protocol (http:// or https://).
</Note>

### 🔑 Step 2: Get Your Credentials

After creating your OAuth client, you'll see it in the client management table with:

- **Client Name**: The name you gave your application
- **Client ID**: Your unique client identifier (you'll need this)
- **Client Secret**: Your secret key (keep this secure!)
- **Redirect URI**: The callback URL you registered

<Warning>
Never share your Client Secret publicly! It's like a password - keep it secure and never commit it to version control.
</Warning>

### 🔄 Step 3: The OAuth Flow

Once you have your Client ID and Client Secret, follow this flow:

#### 1️⃣ Authorize (Get Permission)
Send users to the authorization endpoint with your Client ID. They'll grant permission to your app.

```bash
https://app.aisync.link/login/oauth/authorize?client_id={{client_id}}&redirect_uri={{redirect_uri}}&response_type=code&scope=*' 
```

#### 2️⃣ Get Authorization Code
After the user authorizes, they'll be redirected back to your Redirect URI with a code:
```
YOUR_REDIRECT_URI?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
```

#### 3️⃣ Exchange Code for Token
Use the authorization code to get an access token:

```bash
POST /oauth/token
```

#### 4️⃣ Use Your Access Token
Now you can make API calls using the access token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## 🧩 Understanding Your Credentials

### 🆔 Client ID
- **What it is**: A public identifier for your application
- **Where to find it**: In the OAuth Client Management table
- **Is it secret?**: No, it's safe to include in your frontend code

### 🤫 Client Secret
- **What it is**: A private key that proves your app's identity
- **Where to find it**: In the OAuth Client Management table
- **Is it secret?**: Yes! Never expose this publicly

### 🔁 Redirect URI
- **What it is**: The URL where users are sent after authorization
- **Important**: Must exactly match what you registered
- **Example**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/callback` or `https://yourapp.com/callback`

## 📝 Complete Example Flow

Here's a complete example of how OAuth works:

1. **Create Client** → Get Client ID: `abc123` and Client Secret: `secret456`
2. **User Authorization** → Redirect user to:
   ```
   https://app.aisync.link/login/oauth/authorize?client_id={{client_id}}&redirect_uri={{redirect_uri}}&response_type=code&scope=*
   ```
3. **User Approves** → User is redirected to:
   ```
   https://app.aisync.link/callback?code=xyz789
   ```
4. **Get Token** → Exchange code for token using `/oauth/token`
5. **Make API Calls** → Use the access token in your requests
