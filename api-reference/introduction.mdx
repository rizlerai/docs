## 🚀 What is OAuth?

OAuth is a secure way to let your application access user data without asking for their password. Think of it like giving a hotel key card - you get access to specific rooms (permissions) without sharing your master key (password).

### 🏗️ Step 1: Create Your OAuth Client

Before you can use OAuth, you need to create an OAuth client in your dashboard. This gives you the credentials needed to authenticate.

1. Go to **OAuth Client Management (Advanced)** in your dashboard
2. Click the **"Create New OAuth Client"** button
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **Client Name**: Give your application a descriptive name (e.g., "My Application")
   - **Redirect URI**: Where users will be sent after they authorize your app (e.g., `https://app.aisync.link/test/callback`)
   - **Confidential Client**: Check this box if your app can securely store secrets (recommended for server-side apps)
4. Click **"Create Client"**

<Note>
The Redirect URI must exactly match what you use in your authorization requests. Make sure it's the full URL including the protocol (http:// or https://).
</Note>

### 🔑 Step 2: Get Your Credentials

After creating your OAuth client, you'll see it in the client management table with:

- **Client Name**: The name you gave your application
- **Client ID**: Your unique client identifier (you'll need this)
- **Client Secret**: Your secret key (keep this secure!)
- **Redirect URI**: The callback URL you registered

<Warning>
Never share your Client Secret publicly! It's like a password - keep it secure and never commit it to version control.
</Warning>

### 🔄 Step 3: The OAuth Flow

Once you have your Client ID and Client Secret, follow this flow:

#### 1️⃣ Authorize (Get Permission)
Send users to the authorization endpoint with your Client ID. They'll grant permission to your app.

```bash
https://app.aisync.link/login/oauth/authorize?client_id={{client_id}}&redirect_uri={{redirect_uri}}&response_type=code&scope=*' 
```

#### 2️⃣ Get Authorization Code
After the user authorizes, they'll be redirected back to your Redirect URI with a code:
```
YOUR_REDIRECT_URI?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
```

#### 3️⃣ Exchange Code for Token
Use the authorization code to get an access token:

```bash
POST /oauth/token
```

#### 4️⃣ Use Your Access Token
Now you can make API calls using the access token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## 🧩 Understanding Your Credentials

### 🆔 Client ID
- **What it is**: A public identifier for your application
- **Where to find it**: In the OAuth Client Management table
- **Is it secret?**: No, it's safe to include in your frontend code

### 🤫 Client Secret
- **What it is**: A private key that proves your app's identity
- **Where to find it**: In the OAuth Client Management table
- **Is it secret?**: Yes! Never expose this publicly

### 🔁 Redirect URI
- **What it is**: The URL where users are sent after authorization
- **Important**: Must exactly match what you registered
- **Example**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/callback` or `https://yourapp.com/callback`



## 🔐 Personal Access Tokens

Personal Access Tokens provide a simpler alternative to the OAuth flow. They're like passwords for your API - you can use them immediately without going through the OAuth authorization process.



**🆕 Creating a personal token**

1. Click the **"Create New Personal Token"** button

2. Fill in the token details:
   - **Token Name**: Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Test Package")
   - **Token Expiration**: Choose between:
     - **Never Expire**: Token works indefinitely
     - **Custom Expiration Date**: Set a specific expiration date
   - **Scopes (Permissions)**: Select the permissions you need:
     - **Full Access (*)**: All permissions
     - Or uncheck and select specific scopes
3. Click **"Create Token"**

<Warning>
**Important**: The token will be shown only once. Make sure to copy it immediately! For security reasons, it won't be shown again.
</Warning>

After creating the token, you'll see a confirmation dialog with your new token. Copy it immediately:

**🔧 Using Your Personal Access Token**

Once you have your personal access token, use it in the Authorization header of your API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### 🗂️ Managing Personal Access Tokens

In the Personal Access Tokens table, you can see:
- **Token Name**: The name you gave your token
- **Scopes**: The permissions associated with the token
- **Created**: When the token was generated
- **Expires**: Expiration status (or "Never" if it doesn't expire)
- **Actions**: Revoke the token if needed

<Note>
Personal Access Tokens are ideal for personal use, testing, or server-to-server communication where OAuth flow isn't necessary. For production applications with multiple users, use the OAuth flow instead.
