## Authorize

Start the OAuth authorization flow by redirecting users to the authorization endpoint. Users will grant permission to your application and be redirected back with an authorization code.

<ParamField body="query" path="client_id" type="string" required>
  Your OAuth client ID obtained from the dashboard
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="query" path="redirect_uri" type="string" required>
  The redirect URI registered with your OAuth client. Must exactly match the registered URI.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="query" path="response_type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `code` for authorization code flow
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="query" path="scope" type="string" required>
  The scope of access requested. Use `*` for full access.
</ParamField>

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --location --globoff 'https://app.aisync.link/oauth/authorize?client_id={{client_id}}&redirect_uri={{redirect_uri}}&response_type=code&scope=*'
```

</CodeGroup>

After the user authorizes your application, they will be redirected to your `redirect_uri` with an authorization code:

```
{{redirect_uri}}?code={{authorization_code}}
```

<Note>
The authorization code is single-use and expires quickly. Exchange it for an access token immediately.
