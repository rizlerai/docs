- Choose from predefined time periods or select "Custom dates" for a specific range
- When you select a predefined option (like "Today" or "Last 7 Days"), the system automatically sets the start and end dates

- **Today** - Shows only messages from today

**Note:** The system searches both the "From Number" and "To Number" fields, so you'll see messages where your selected number appears in either position.

### ✅ Status Filter

**Purpose:** Filter messages based on their delivery or processing status.
