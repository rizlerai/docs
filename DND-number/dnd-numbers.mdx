The DND Numbers module allows you to manage phone numbers that should not be contacted through certain communication channels. DND stands for **Do Not Disturb** — these are numbers where people have requested not to receive specific types of messages or calls. When you add a number to this list, the system remembers which channels to block, helping you respect preferences and stay compliant.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **What are DND Numbers?**
  
  Numbers on this list have one or more communication channels blocked (email, SMS, calls, voicemail, or inbound calls/SMS). The system uses this list to prevent sending messages or placing calls through blocked channels.

## 🚦 Understanding DND Status

The **DND Status** column shows colored badges indicating which communication channels are blocked for each number. Each badge type has a distinct color; a single number can have **multiple badges** if multiple channels are blocked (e.g. both DND Email and DND SMS).

| Badge | Color | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **DND All** | Red | Do not contact through any channel — no email, SMS, calls, or voicemail |
| **DND Email** | Blue | Do not send emails |
| **DND SMS** | Green | Do not send text messages |
| **DND Call Voicemail** | Yellow | Do not place calls or leave voicemails |
| **DND Inbound Call SMS** | Light blue | Do not allow incoming calls and SMS |

## ✏️ Editing an Existing DND Number

**Purpose:** Update contact information or change which channels are blocked for a number already on the list.

**How it works:**

1. Find the number in the table and click **"Edit"** in the **Action** column

4. Click **"Submit"** to save all other changes; the form closes and the list updates with a success message

<img src="/images/DND-number/edit-form.png" alt="Edit DND Number Form" className="rounded-lg border shadow-sm mb-4" />

## 🗑️ Deleting a DND Number

**Purpose:** Remove a number from the DND list permanently.

**How it works:**

4. If you confirm, the number is removed from the list and a success message is shown

**Warning:** Deletion is permanent. To have the number on the list again, you must add it as a new entry.

## 🎛️ Filter Options and Search

Use the filters at the top of the page to narrow the list by date range and DND status; click **"Filter"** to apply. Use the search box above the table to find entries by first name, last name, area code, email, who added the entry, or created date — results update as you type (case-insensitive, partial matches supported).

<img src="/images/DND-number/filters.png" alt="DND Numbers Filters" className="rounded-lg border shadow-sm mb-4" />

**Date range:** Choose a predefined period (Today, Yesterday, This Week, Last 7 Days, Last 14 Days, This Month, Last 30 Days, Last Month, etc.) or **Custom dates** to pick your own start and end date. For **Custom dates**, the Start Date and End Date fields become active; click them to open the calendar. Click **"Filter"** to apply. Dates follow your account's time zone.

| Option | What it includes |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Custom dates** | Your own start and end date |
| **Today** | Numbers added today only |
| **Yesterday** | Numbers added yesterday |
| **This Week (Sun - Today)** | From Sunday of current week to today |
| **This Week (Mon - Today)** | From Monday of current week to today |
| **Last 7 Days** | Past 7 days including today |
| **Last Week (Sun - Sat)** | Previous Sunday through Saturday |
| **Last Week (Mon - Sun)** | Previous Monday through Sunday |
| **Last Business Week (Mon - Fri)** | Previous Monday through Friday |
| **Last 14 Days** | Past 14 days including today |
| **This Month** | First day of current month to today |
| **Last 30 Days** | Past 30 days including today |
| **Last Month** | Entire previous month |

**DND status:** Open the **"DND Status"** dropdown and select **All**, **DND all channels**, **Emails**, **Text Messages**, **Calls & Voicemails**, or **DND Inbound Calls and SMS**, then click **"Filter"** to show only entries matching that status.

---

## ⚙️ How the Module Works

**When you add a number:** The system stores all information you provide and your DND Status selections, records who added the number and when, and which company it belongs to. The number is immediately active and used to block the selected channels.

**When you edit:** You can change any contact or DND fields. DND Status checkbox changes are saved immediately; clicking **Submit** saves the rest (name, phone, email, area code, etc.).

**DND status logic:** **DND all channels** is the most restrictive and clears individual channel options. Individual options (Emails, Text Messages, Calls & Voicemails) can be combined. **DND Inbound Calls and SMS** is independent and can be combined with others or used alone. Selecting **DND all channels** clears individual channels; selecting an individual channel clears **DND all channels**.

**Phone number formatting:** You can enter the number in any format (with or without dashes, spaces, or parentheses); the system converts it automatically. **Time zone:** All dates and times are shown in your account's time zone. **Company restrictions:** Non-administrators see only their company's DND numbers; administrators see all companies. The system tracks company per number automatically.

## 📋 Summary

With the DND Numbers module you can:

- **Add** numbers with contact details and DND preferences
- **Edit** entries to update information or DND settings (DND checkbox changes save immediately when editing)
- **Delete** numbers when no longer needed (permanent; add again if required later)
- **Filter** by date range and DND status, and **search** the table
