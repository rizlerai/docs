### 🔄 Call Transfers By Agent

> **Track and analyze when your AI agents transfer calls to human representatives**

A call transfer occurs when your AI agent hands off a call to a human representative or another phone number. This happens when callers request human assistance, complex issues arise, or your transfer criteria are met.

---

The **Transfers by Agent** chart shows which agents are transferring the most calls using a doughnut chart visualization.

![Transfers by Agent Chart](/images/dashboard/analytics/transfer-by-agent.png)

**Reading the Transfers by Agent chart:**

| Element           | Description                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Colored Segments** | Each color represents a different AI agent          |
| **Segment Size**     | Larger segments = more transfers by that agent      |
| **Center Space**     | Empty center for clean visualization                |

**How to interpret:**

- If "Agent Sarah" has the largest segment, she transferred the most calls.
- Smaller segments indicate agents with fewer transfers.
- Hover over any segment to see exact numbers.


**How to view transfer details:**

1. Click directly on a colored segment of the doughnut chart,
2. Select an agent’s name from the legend below the chart,
3. Or, if there are many agents, click the **"+X more"** link and pick an agent from the expanded list.
