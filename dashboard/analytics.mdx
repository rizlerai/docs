The **Transfers by Agent** chart shows which agents are transferring the most calls using a doughnut chart visualization.

| **Segment Size**     | Larger segments = more transfers by that agent      |
| **Center Space**     | Empty center for clean visualization                |

**How to interpret:**

- If "Agent Sarah" has the largest segment, she transferred the most calls.
- Smaller segments indicate agents with fewer transfers.
- Hover over any segment to see exact numbers.


**How to view transfer details:**

1. Click directly on a colored segment of the doughnut chart,
