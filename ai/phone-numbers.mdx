## üõ°Ô∏è Spam Protection - Detailed Guide

### What is Spam Protection?

Spam protection is a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks your phone numbers' reputation with carriers and prevents them from being flagged as spam.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  **Spam Protected Numbers** are phone numbers that are continuously monitored for spam reputation, carrier compliance, and deliverability status. The system helps prevent your numbers from being flagged or blocked by carriers.
</Callout>

### üîÑ How Spam Protection Works:

#### 1. **24/7 Monitoring**
- Continuous scanning of carrier databases
- Real-time reputation tracking
- Automatic status updates

#### 2. **Status Types**:
- **üü¢ Clean**: Number is in good standing with no spam flags
- **üî¥ Flagged**: Number has been reported for spam (shows carrier details like T-Mobile, Verizon)
- **üü° Pending**: Number is under review or verification
- **‚ö´ Blocked**: Number is blocked by carriers

 
#### 3. **Automatic Actions**:
- **Alert System**: Immediate notifications for issues
- **Remediation**: Automated and manual fix processes

### üí° Why Spam Protection is Useful:

- **üìà Deliverability**: Ensures your calls/messages reach recipients

- **üèÜ Reputation Management**: Protects your business reputation
- **üí∞ Cost Savings**: Prevents expensive number replacement
- **üìä Analytics**: Provides detailed performance metrics

## üîë Token Management - Detailed Guide

### What are Tokens?

**Tokens** are mappings between GoHighLevel (GHL) fields and the data used by the AI during incoming calls only. They allow you to specify which GHL fields the AI can access and use when handling inbound calls. Only the fields you map will be available to the AI for incoming call workflows.

![Token Management](/images/ai/phone-number/token.png)

### GoHighLevel (GHL) Field Mapping (Incoming Calls Only)

Map the data fields from your GHL account to the fields used by the AI during incoming calls. This ensures the AI has access to the right information for each inbound call.

#### Example Field Mappings (Incoming):

**GHL Location**
- Maps to: The GHL location where data is stored

**Phone Number**
- Maps to: The contact's phone number

**Email**
- Maps to: The contact's email address

**First Name**
- Maps to: The contact's first name

**Last Name**
- Maps to: The contact's last name

**Address Fields**
- **City**: Maps to the city field in GHL
- **Zip Code**: Maps to the zip code field in GHL
- **Country**: Maps to the country field in GHL
- **Address**: Maps to the address field in GHL

**Custom Text Field**
- Maps to: Any custom field you want to use during the incoming call

> Only the mapped fields are used by the AI during incoming calls. 

### üîê How Tokens Work (Simple Explanation):

Think of tokens as labels that tell the AI which piece of your contact info to use during a call. For example, you connect "First Name" in your system to "First Name" for the AI, so it knows what to say. You just match up the fields you want the AI to use‚Äînothing complicated.
