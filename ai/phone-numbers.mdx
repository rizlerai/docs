## üõ°Ô∏è Spam Protection - Detailed Guide

### Why Spam Protection Matters

Nearly all consumers‚Äî98%‚Äîsend calls they suspect are spam directly to voicemail, and up to 90% routinely screen incoming calls to avoid potential scams or unsolicited sales. To address these challenges, we developed Spam Protection: a dedicated solution designed to protect your caller ID reputation and maximize the likelihood that your business calls are answered.

Maintaining your company‚Äôs reputation is essential. Spam Protection provides full visibility into the delivery status of your outbound calls, enabling you to promptly identify any numbers flagged as ‚Äúspam likely‚Äù or ‚Äúscam likely‚Äù by carriers or call-blocking services. With real-time monitoring, you can respond proactively to maintain effective outreach.

### What are the benefits of Spam Protected Numbers?

- **Comprehensive Auditing:** Track the flag status of your phone numbers across all major carriers and popular call-blocking apps.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Instantly see how your numbers appear to customers on different devices and networks.
- **Immediate Alerts:** Get notified the moment a number is flagged, so you can remove it from use and avoid damaging your brand‚Äôs reputation.

## üîë Token Management - Detailed Guide

### What are Tokens?

**Tokens** are mappings between GoHighLevel (GHL) fields and the data used by the AI during incoming calls only. They allow you to specify which GHL fields the AI can access and use when handling inbound calls. Only the fields you map will be available to the AI for incoming call workflows.

![Token Management](/images/ai/phone-number/token.png)

### GoHighLevel (GHL) Field Mapping (Incoming Calls Only)

Map the data fields from your GHL account to the fields used by the AI during incoming calls. This ensures the AI has access to the right information for each inbound call.

#### Example Field Mappings (Incoming):

**GHL Location**
- Maps to: The GHL location where data is stored

**Phone Number**
- Maps to: The contact's phone number

**Email**
- Maps to: The contact's email address

**First Name**
- Maps to: The contact's first name

**Last Name**
- Maps to: The contact's last name

**Address Fields**
- **City**: Maps to the city field in GHL
- **Zip Code**: Maps to the zip code field in GHL
- **Country**: Maps to the country field in GHL
- **Address**: Maps to the address field in GHL

**Custom Text Field**
- Maps to: Any custom field you want to use during the incoming call

> Only the mapped fields are used by the AI during incoming calls. 

### üîê How Tokens Work (Simple Explanation):

Think of tokens as labels that tell the AI which piece of your contact info to use during a call. For example, you connect "First Name" in your system to "First Name" for the AI, so it knows what to say. You just match up the fields you want the AI to use‚Äînothing complicated.
