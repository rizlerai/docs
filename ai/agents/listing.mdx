**😕 Agent Not Showing**

- **Verify Agent Status**: Ensure the agent isn’t set to "Inactive", as filters may hide them.
- **Refresh the Page**: Sometimes a quick refresh loads recent changes.
- **Check Search Filters**: Make sure your search term isn’t hiding the agent by accident.

**📞 Numbers Not Working**
- **Verify Assignments**: Confirm the number is properly assigned to the agent.
- **Check Number Status**: Ensure the number is not flagged or out of service.
- **Test Alternatives**: Try assigning and using a different inbound/outbound number.
- **Contact Support**: If issues persist, reach out to the support team for assistance.

**📤 Import/Export Issues**
- **Check File Format**: Only JSON files are supported for import and export.
- **Check File Size Limits**: Files that are too large may not be accepted—try a smaller file.
- **Permissions**: Make sure you have the correct permissions for these operations.
- **Try Another File**: If one file fails, test with a known good example to isolate the issue.
