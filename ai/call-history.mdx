*The AI Call History interface provides comprehensive filtering options and a detailed table view of all call records.*

## 🚀 Getting Started

The main page shows a table of all your call records. Each row represents one call with key information like time, agent name, phone numbers, duration, and more. Use the filters at the top to find specific calls, or click the 👁️ eye icon to view complete call details.

## 🔍 Filters

All filters work together to help you find exactly what you need. Most update automatically, but click the **Filter** button to apply all changes at once.

### 🏢 Select Company

Choose a company to see only calls associated with that company. Leave it unselected to see all companies.

### 🤖 Select Agent

Filter calls by the AI agent that handled them. Search by typing the agent name in the dropdown.

### 📅 Date Range

Choose from predefined ranges (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, This Month, etc.) or select "Custom dates" to pick your own start and end dates. All times are shown in your account's time zone.

### ⏱️ Min/Max Duration

Set minimum and maximum call duration to find longer conversations or filter out very short calls. Options range from 5 seconds to 2 hours.

### 📲 Call Direction

Filter by call type:
- **All:** Shows all calls
- **Inbound:** 📥 Calls you received
- **Outbound:** 📤 Calls you made

Find calls based on the caller's emotional tone:
- **Positive:** 😄 Happy, satisfied customers
- **Neutral:** 😐 Normal interactions
- **Negative:** 😞 Unhappy or frustrated customers
- **Unknown:** ❓ Sentiment couldn't be determined

💡 **Tip:** Use "Negative" to find calls where customers were unhappy so you can review and improve your service.

### ✅ Call Successful

Filter to see only successful calls (those that achieved their goal) or unsuccessful ones.

### 📱 From/To Number

Type a phone number to find all calls made from or to that specific number. Works best with complete phone numbers.

**How to export:**

1. Set your filters to show the calls you want
2. Click the **Filter** button to apply filters

When you have many calls, they're split across multiple pages. Use the page numbers or Previous/Next buttons at the bottom to navigate. Change the number of records per page using the dropdown (typically 10, 25, 50, or 100).
