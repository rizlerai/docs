![Call Transfer Dialog](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/advance/call-transfer.png)

### 📝 Basic Transfer Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Description Field">
    **Purpose**: Brief description of the transfer scenario  
    **Example**: "hello transfer" - Simple identifier for this transfer configuration  
    **Usage**: Helps team members understand when this transfer is used
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transfer Destination">
    **Purpose**: Defines where the call should be routed  
    **Options**: 
    - **Dynamic Routing** (`transfer_destination.type: "inferred"`)  
      - The AI model infers the correct transfer destination based on context.
      - **Prompt** (`transfer_destination.prompt`): Provide a specific instruction or context for the transfer, which will be combined with the global prompt and call transcript to deduce the right number. You can use dynamic variables here (e.g., `{{customer_issue}}`).
    - **Static Routing**: Route calls to a specific, pre-set phone number or extension.  
      - **How it works**: You can specify a fixed E.164 number (e.g., `+1234567890`), a department extension, or use a dynamic variable such as `{{transfer_number}}` to determine the destination at runtime.  
    - **Specific phone numbers**
    - **Department extensions**
    
    **Retail Application**: Route customers to appropriate departments (sales, support, billing)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dynamic Routing Logic">
    **Purpose**: Configure AI-driven transfer destination using the `transfer_destination.type` and `transfer_destination.prompt` fields.
![Call Transfer Dialog](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/advance/call-transfer-dynamic.png)
    **transfer_destination.type**:  
    - **Required**  
    - **Options**: `"inferred"`  
    - Set to `"inferred"` to enable the AI to deduce the correct transfer destination.

    **transfer_destination.prompt**:  
    - **Required**  
    - Provide a prompt that guides the AI in selecting the right number or department.  
    - The model combines this prompt with the global prompt and the call transcript to infer the best transfer destination.  
    - You can use dynamic variables (e.g., `{{customer_issue}}`, `{{customer_priority}}`) to tailor the routing.

    **Example Prompt**:  
    - "Transfer this call to the most appropriate sales agent based on the customer's inquiry and priority."
    - "Route to the senior support agent if the customer is VIP, otherwise to the general support queue."

    **Retell AI Use**:  
    - With Retell AI, you can intelligently route high-value customers to senior sales agents by crafting a prompt such as:  
      `"If the customer is identified as VIP, transfer to the senior sales line; otherwise, route to the general sales team."`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Static Routing">
    **Purpose**: Route calls to a fixed, pre-defined destination using explicit transfer fields.

    **transfer_destination.type**  
    - **Type**: `enum<string>` (**required**)  
    - **Description**: The type of transfer destination.  
    - **Available options**:  
      - `predefined` (Use this for static routing to a specific number or extension.)

    **transfer_destination.number**  
    - **Type**: `string` (**required**)  
    - **Description**: The number to transfer to, in E.164 format (e.g., `+1234567890`) or a dynamic variable (e.g., `{{transfer_number}}`).  
    - **Example**:  
      - `+18005551234`  
      - `{{preferred_agent_number}}`

    **transfer_destination.extension**  
    - **Type**: `string` (optional)  
    - **Description**: Extension digits to dial after the main number connects. Sent via DTMF. Allow digits, `*`, `#`.  
    - **Example**:  
      - `"123*456#"`

    **How it works**:  
    - The transfer always goes to the same phone number or department, regardless of customer or context.
    - You can specify a fixed E.164 number, a department extension, or use a dynamic variable for runtime selection.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 📞 Displayed Phone Number

The **Displayed Phone Number** controls which caller ID shows when the system transfers a call. You can set it to either:

- **AI Agent Number**: Shows the Rizz AI Agent’s assigned phone number for all transfers.  
  - *Use when*: You want all calls to appear from your main business or agent line—ensures consistency.
  - *Behavior*: Caller ID always displays the AI Agent’s number.

- **Lead/User Number**: Shows the lead's or user's own phone number for each transfer.
  - *Use when*: You want calls to look like they're coming directly from the lead or user.
  - *Requirements*: Your telephony provider must support caller ID override; check with your carrier.
  - *Behavior*: Caller ID dynamically displays the relevant user’s or lead’s number.

**Tip:**  
If your provider doesn’t allow caller ID override, use the AI Agent Number option. Always test after making changes to confirm the correct caller ID appears.

### 💬 Warm Transfer Configuration
<img src="/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/advance/call-transfer-warm-options.png" alt="Warm Transfer" />

Warm Transfer offers a highly customizable and seamless handoff experience. Here are the key configuration options and advanced features you can enable:
#### 🧑‍💼 Human Detection
The AI can automatically detect when a human agent joins the call, ensuring that context and introductions are delivered at the right moment. This helps avoid confusion and guarantees a smooth transition for both the customer and the agent.

#### 🎵 On-hold Music
During the warm transfer process, customers can listen to relaxing or branded on-hold music while waiting for the agent to join. This feature enhances the customer experience and can be customized to match your brand.

#### ☎️ Navigate IVR (Interactive Voice Response)
If your transfer destination uses an IVR system, the AI can automatically navigate menu prompts by sending DTMF tones (keypad inputs). This allows the AI to reach the correct department or extension before connecting the customer, making the transfer process faster and more accurate.

# ☎️ Press Digit IVR Navigation  

**Empower your Retell AI agent to breeze through phone menus using DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) keypad input!**  
> *Requires Call API v2. Need to upgrade? [See the migration guide.]*

---

![IVR Press Digit](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/advance/press-digit-IVR.png)

### 🚦 Why Press Digit is a Game-Changer

When your AI agent makes outbound calls, it often meets IVR systems—those automated voices asking you to "press 1 for Support, press 2 for Sales." With the Press Digit feature, your agent can instantly handle these prompts, saving time and keeping conversations on track.

- **Voice IVR:** Some menus accept spoken instructions. For these, just add a prompt so your agent talks back!
- **DTMF IVR:** Most menus expect keypad presses. This is where Press Digit shines.

---

## 🚀 Get Started: Enable Press Digit in 3 Easy Steps


![IVR Press Digit](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/advance/press-digit-IVR-edit.png)

### 1️⃣ Add the "Press Digit" Tool

- Go to your agent’s configuration.
- Add the **Press Digit tool**.
- (Optional) Add a description, such as:  
  _"Automatically press 1 to speak to customer care."_

### 2️⃣ Give Your Agent Smart Prompts

Enhance your agent's logic by updating prompts like:

- **For Unpredictable Menus:**  
  ```
  If you hear an IVR menu, listen carefully and press the right number to reach the right team.
  ```
- **For Known Options:**  
  ```
  Immediately press 2 to reach the Billing Department after the call connects.
  ```

### 3️⃣ See It in Action!

- Make a real or test call to a line with an IVR menu.
- Or, mimic an IVR at your own number (“Press 1 for anything!”).
- Watch as your agent navigates the options—hands free!

---


> **Tip:** The smarter your agent’s prompt, the smoother your IVR journeys!
