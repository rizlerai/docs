### üìù Basic Transfer Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Description Field">
    **Purpose**: Brief description of the transfer scenario  
    **Example**: "hello transfer" - Simple identifier for this transfer configuration  
    **Usage**: Helps team members understand when this transfer is used
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transfer Destination">
    **Purpose**: Defines where the call should be routed  
    **Options**: 
    - **Dynamic Routing** (`transfer_destination.type: "inferred"`)  
      - The AI model infers the correct transfer destination based on context.
      - **Prompt** (`transfer_destination.prompt`): Provide a specific instruction or context for the transfer, which will be combined with the global prompt and call transcript to deduce the right number. You can use dynamic variables here (e.g., `{{customer_issue}}`).
    - **Static Routing**: Route calls to a specific, pre-set phone number or extension.  
      - **How it works**: You can specify a fixed E.164 number (e.g., `+1234567890`), a department extension, or use a dynamic variable such as `{{transfer_number}}` to determine the destination at runtime.  
    - **Specific phone numbers**
    - **Department extensions**
    
    **Retail Application**: Route customers to appropriate departments (sales, support, billing)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dynamic Routing Logic">
    **Purpose**: Configure AI-driven transfer destination using the `transfer_destination.type` and `transfer_destination.prompt` fields.
![Call Transfer Dialog](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/advance/call-transfer-dynamic.png)
    **transfer_destination.type**:  
    - **Required**  
    - **Options**: `"inferred"`  
    - Set to `"inferred"` to enable the AI to deduce the correct transfer destination.

    **transfer_destination.prompt**:  
    - **Required**  
    - Provide a prompt that guides the AI in selecting the right number or department.  
    - The model combines this prompt with the global prompt and the call transcript to infer the best transfer destination.  
    - You can use dynamic variables (e.g., `{{customer_issue}}`, `{{customer_priority}}`) to tailor the routing.

    **Example Prompt**:  
    - "Transfer this call to the most appropriate sales agent based on the customer's inquiry and priority."
    - "Route to the senior support agent if the customer is VIP, otherwise to the general support queue."

    **Retell AI Use**:  
    - With Retell AI, you can intelligently route high-value customers to senior sales agents by crafting a prompt such as:  
      `"If the customer is identified as VIP, transfer to the senior sales line; otherwise, route to the general sales team."`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Static Routing">
    **Purpose**: Route calls to a fixed, pre-defined destination using explicit transfer fields.

    **transfer_destination.type**  
    - **Type**: `enum<string>` (**required**)  
    - **Description**: The type of transfer destination.  
    - **Available options**:  
      - `predefined` (Use this for static routing to a specific number or extension.)

    **transfer_destination.number**  
    - **Type**: `string` (**required**)  
    - **Description**: The number to transfer to, in E.164 format (e.g., `+1234567890`) or a dynamic variable (e.g., `{{transfer_number}}`).  
    - **Example**:  
      - `+18005551234`  
      - `{{preferred_agent_number}}`

    **transfer_destination.extension**  
    - **Type**: `string` (optional)  
    - **Description**: Extension digits to dial after the main number connects. Sent via DTMF. Allow digits, `*`, `#`.  
    - **Example**:  
      - `"123*456#"`

    **How it works**:  
    - The transfer always goes to the same phone number or department, regardless of customer or context.
    - You can specify a fixed E.164 number, a department extension, or use a dynamic variable for runtime selection.
  </Accordion>
