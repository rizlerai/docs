![Voice & Language](/images/ai/Ai-agent/edit/voice-language/image9.png)

You can fine-tune the selected voice using the settings icon next to the voice name. This opens a modal with the following adjustable parameters, each controlled by a slider (range: 0.00‚Äì2.00, default: 1):

- **Voice Speed**: Adjusts how fast the agent speaks. Lower values slow down the speech, while higher values speed it up.
- **Voice Temperature**: Controls the expressiveness and variability of the voice. Lower values make the voice more consistent and neutral, while higher values add more variation and expressiveness.
- **Voice Volume**: Sets the loudness of the agent's voice. Lower values make the voice quieter, higher values make it louder.

You can experiment with these sliders to achieve the desired voice characteristics for your agent. Click "Close" to exit the settings modal.
