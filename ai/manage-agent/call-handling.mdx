## ⏳ Call Duration & Silence Settings

Visually configure key parameters that define how long your AI agent's calls last and how silence is managed. Use sliders to set thresholds for end-of-call silence, max call length, and how long your agent pauses before speaking.

  className="rounded-lg border shadow-sm"

**Features:**
- **End Call on Silence:** Specify the duration of continuous silence (in seconds) that ends a call (e.g., 10s).
- **Max Call Duration:** Set a maximum allowed time for any call handled by the agent (e.g., 15 minutes).
- **Pause Before Speaking:** Adjust how long the agent waits before saying the first word after the call is answered (e.g., 0–5 seconds).
  
_Use these settings to ensure natural timing, prevent accidental hang-ups, and provide a seamless experience._
