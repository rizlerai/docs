## üîÑ Redial Settings

Control automatic redial behavior for failed calls.

- **Number of Attempts**: Set how many times the system will retry connecting if a call fails.
- **Redial After**: Specify the wait time (e.g., 1 min) between redial attempts.
- **Redial After Voicemail Detection**: Choose whether to retry the call when a voicemail is detected (*Yes* or *No*).
- **Change Redial Agent**: Enable switching to a different agent when redialing. This helps improve answer rates by automatically assigning follow-up calls to another available agent if the initial attempt was unsuccessful.
