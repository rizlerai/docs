### 📝 Prompt Configuration

The heart of your agent’s intelligence—this is where you define instructions, greetings, behaviors, and flows.

#### 🧩 Core Configuration Areas:

- **Project Instructions/Requests:**  
  Define the main purpose, goals, and what the agent should do.

- **Welcome Message:**  
  Configure how the agent starts every conversation.  
  ![Greeting Message](/images/ai//AI-agent/edit/general/welcome-message.png)  
  Choose dynamic or custom message greetings for inbound and outbound interactions. Dynamic variables personalize greetings, e.g. `{{first_name}}`.

- **Prompt Configuration:**  
  Define your agent’s main instructions, requests, and conversational logic—this shapes how it responds and acts.  
  ![Project Prompt UI](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/general/prompt.png)
  You can copy and paste entire prompt sets if you want to reuse a setup across agents.  
  Use dynamic variables (like `{{first_name}}`, `{{company}}`, and others) inside your prompts to personalize responses—these auto-fill with each contact’s actual data.

- **Greeting :**  
  Customize how your agent greets contacts for both outbound and inbound calls.  
  ![Greetings UI](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/general/greeting-phrase.png)
  In the "Greetings" section, you can set a different greeting phrase for outbound scenarios. For example:  
  ```
  ➔ "Hi {{first_name}}, this is Sarah from Orbit, warm hello!"
  ```
  The interface supports dynamic variables such as `{{first_name}}` to further personalize greetings.  
  Use the **Expand** button to view or edit more complex greeting templates and see all available tags.


- **Call Flow:**  
  Set up the exact call sequence your agent should follow (Introduction → Discovery → Offer → Close).  
  ![Call Flow](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/general/call-flow.png)

- **Character and Style:**  
  Give your agent a personality, tone, and behavioral traits.  
  ![Character](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/general/character.png)
  Define how formal, casual, or playful your agent should be, including “human-like” fillers if needed.

- **Transfer Call:**  
  Set up how and when the agent should transfer to a human, plus fallback instructions if no one answers.  
  ![Transfer Call](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/general/transfer-call.png)

- **Critical Instructions:**  
  Add strict guidelines for agent behavior—keep conversations human-like, never reveal it is AI, safeguard sensitive info, and follow call rules.  
  ![Critical instructions](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/general/critical-instructions.png)

- **Allowed Custom Variables:**  
  Specify metadata fields (from GoHighLevel or custom fields) the agent can use for personalization in any prompt, greeting, or message.  
  Sample variables: `{{first_name}}`, `{{last_name}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{phone}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{current_dateTime}}`, `{{join_meeting_pin}}`.

- Copy-paste variables to personalize any dialog line.
- Use curly braces `{field}` for all variable tags.
- Includes one-click copy, context hints, and a collapsible interface.

### 🏢 What Does Your Company Do

Configure how agents answer “What does your company do?” and similar questions about your business’s value proposition.

- Use a simple, conversational format:  
  - **Problem** / Pain → “Most [industry] struggle with…”  
  - **Solution** → “We help by…”  
  - **Result** → “So you…”  
  - **Pivot** → “The best way to see it is on a quick strategy call.”
- Keep answers short (10–15 sec) and guide conversation naturally toward your desired next step.
- Example template:  
  ~ "We build AI tools that handle the boring parts of outreach and follow-up. That way business owners don't lose leads and can close deals faster. Honestly though, it's easier to just show you live on a strategy call — that way you'll see exactly how it works."
- Collapsible editor, structured format, and room for multiple response templates.

### 📜 Script

Define the step-by-step call flow and script the agent will follow:

- Start with greeting and introduction
- Proceed to qualification, discovery, and booking phases
- Use a tilde `~` to begin each line for clarity
- Drag-and-drop ordering, color-coded phases, and a collapsible script editor panel

Example script:
```
~ Hi, this is [Agent Name] calling from [Company]. How are you today?
~ The reason for my call is to see if you’re open to a quick chat about [value proposition/solution].
~ Can I ask—are you currently facing challenges with [problem/industry pain point]?
~ I’d love to show you how we’ve helped others by [brief benefit].
~ What works better for you—a call this week or next for a quick walkthrough?
~ To make sure you get the most out of it, is there anything specific you’d like us to cover?
~ Amazing. I’ve booked you in and will send you a confirmation—looking forward to our chat!
```

### 🛡️ Objection Handling

Train your AI agent with strong, ready-to-use responses for the most common objections.  
- Editable objection-response pairs
- Copy to clipboard and search/filter features
- Structure by topic (e.g., “Not interested”, “What is this?”, “Already work with someone”, etc.)

| **Objection**        | **Example Response** |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Not interested       | "Totally understand. A lot of business owners said the same..." |
| What is this about?  | "Good question. Based on what I see, your company..."          |
| Send me something.   | "Absolutely! Is email best? I'll send you a quick overview..." |
| …                    | …                                                         |
