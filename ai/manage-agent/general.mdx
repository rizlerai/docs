## 👋 Welcome Message

Configure how your AI agent starts conversations. Use this setting to control whether the agent greets users proactively or waits for users to speak first—helping you tailor the experience to your specific workflow or customer journey.

**Purpose:**  
Choose the initiation style that best fits your use case:
- If you want the agent to welcome users and guide the conversation from the start, select an AI-initiated greeting.
- If you prefer the agent to remain silent until the user engages, select the user-initiated option.
 **🎯 Initiation Options**

- **AI Initiates (Dynamic Message):** The agent begins with an automatically generated greeting.
- **AI Initiates (Custom Message):** The agent starts with your defined welcome message,"Hi, How's your day?"   .
- **User Initiates:** The agent remains silent and only responds after the user speaks.

Dynamic variables are supported for personalization in greeting messages.

![General](/images/ai//AI-agent/edit/general/welcome-message.png)
## 💬 General Prompt

The General Prompt is where you define the core behavior, instructions, and conversational personality of your AI agent. It governs how your agent handles conversations, responds to various scenarios, and maintains consistency throughout all interactions.

**🔧 Available Dynamic Variables**

A list of available dynamic variables is displayed at the top of the prompt configuration editor interface for easy reference:

```
{{phone_number}} {{first_name}} {{last_name}} {{email_Address}} {{address}} {{city}} {{zip_code}} {{country}} {{hello_how_are_you_i_am_check_last_field_for_testing_layout_okay}} {{current_dateTime}} {{talk_meeting_opt}}
```

- Hovering over any variable in the editor may reveal its full text or usage tip.

## 👋 Greeting Phrase

**Purpose:** How is the agent going to start every conversation

The Greeting Phrase setting controls how your agent begins each conversation—either by greeting the user first or waiting for the user to speak. This shapes the initial user experience and sets the tone for the interaction.

 **🎯 Greeting Phrases Configuration**

The interface provides separate configuration for different conversation scenarios:

**📞 Outbound Greeting Phrase**
- **When used**: When the AI agent initiates contact with prospects
- **Example**: `→ ~"Hey uh, {{first_name}}?"`
- **Behavior**: `→ Wait for prospect to respond`
- **Purpose**: Sets the tone for outbound calls and waits for the prospect's response

 **📱 Inbound Greeting Phrase**  
- **When used**: When prospects initiate contact or call back
- **Example**: `→ ~"Thanks for calling back, that's {{first_name}}, right?"`
- **Behavior**: `→ Wait for prospect to respond`
- **Purpose**: Acknowledges the caller and confirms their identity before proceeding

 **🔧 Dynamic Variables**
Dynamic variables (like `{{first_name}}`) can be used to personalize greetings for each contact, making conversations feel more natural and tailored to the individual.

## 🔄 Transfer Call

**Purpose:** Define agent behavior for transferring calls to a human before booking, including fallback and script details.

The Transfer Call configuration ensures your AI agent always prioritizes a warm handoff to a human when a prospect is ready to book an appointment, before automatically booking themselves. If a transfer is unsuccessful, clear backup and informative procedures are followed to maintain professionalism and appointment success.

![Transfer Call](/images/ai/AI-agent/edit/general/transfer-call.png)

**🎯 Transfer Call Protocol**

1. **Always Attempt Transfer First**  
   When a user is ready to book an appointment, do **not** immediately book it.  
   First, attempt to transfer the call to a live human scheduler, manager, or consulting coordinator.  
   _Script example:_  
   > "Let me check if the scheduling coordinator is available. If so, I’ll transfer you; if not, I’ll get back on the line and help you book your appointment."

2. **If Transfer Fails:**  
   - Remain on the line and clearly communicate:  
     > "It looks like no one is currently available to assist you directly. Let’s go ahead and get your appointment booked."
   - Proceed to book the appointment, confirming all required details.

3. **If Transfer Succeeds:**  
   - Announce the transfer:  
     > "I’m going to introduce you to my colleague, who will assist you further in booking."
   - Stay on the line briefly to ensure the handoff, or exit as per business protocol.

**Additional Fallbacks & Reminders:**
- *Business hour limits*: If the team is unavailable, explain the reason with sample scripts (see above).
- *Office hours example*:  
  > "Our office is open Monday through Friday, with hours ranging from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM depending on the day. Would you like me to check for the earliest possible time, or enter details so a scheduler can confirm at your earliest convenience?"

- *Finalize fallback*:  
  > If a transfer fails or no staff accept, the AI should handle the booking directly:  
  > "I’ll take charge now and book your appointment."

**💡 Best Practices**
- Be transparent about transfer attempts.
- Never leave the user hanging; always return to complete booking if transfer is not possible.
- Record transfer attempts in call notes for performance tracking.

This ensures consistent personalization and accurate data population throughout your AI agent's workflow.

**How to Use:**
- In the "Custom Field References" area, locate the field variable you wish to use (e.g., `{contact.phone}`).
- Copy the desired reference.
- Paste it anywhere in the agent instructions or script sections where dynamic data is required.
- The platform will automatically replace these tags with real data during live calls and automations.

> **Tip:** Always use the curly-brace format (e.g., `{field_name}`) for custom fields to ensure proper data mapping.

**Example Workflow:**
- Use `{lead.firstName}` to greet the user by name in a script.
- Insert `{appointment.link}` in confirmation messages for direct calendar access.

## ❓ What Does Your Company Does

**Purpose:** Problems that you solve with your unique value proposition

The "If Asked" section provides structured guidance for how your AI agent should respond when prospects ask about your company's services. This configuration ensures consistent, compelling responses that highlight your unique value proposition while naturally guiding conversations toward booking appointments.

When asked 'What does your company do?' you must respond naturally and conversationally, never robotic.

The response configuration includes:

- **Problem Identification**: How to identify and articulate customer pain points
- **Solution Presentation**: Clear explanation of your company's offerings

Problem / Pain → "Most [industry / business owners / teams] struggle with..."
Solution → "We help by [what your company enables / automates / improves]..."
Result → "That way they [benefit / save time / make more money / scale faster]."
Pivot → "But honestly the best way to see it is on a quick strategist call."

Sample Templates:
~"We build AI tools that handle the boring parts of outreach and follow-up. That way business owners don't lose leads and can close deals faster. Honestly though, it's easier to just show you live on a strategy call — that way you'll see exactly how it works."

Golden Rules:

## 📞 Script

**Purpose:** Define the exact call sequence—what the AI agent says, and when.

The Script section specifies the precise script your AI agent will follow during calls. By setting the line-by-line order, you ensure your agent delivers a natural, consistent, and effective conversation every time.

**🎯 Script Structure**

The script flow covers these key phases:

1. **Greeting**: Agent opens the call and introduces themselves and your company.
2. **Intro**: Agent establishes rapport and sets the intent for the conversation.

4. **Demo Pre-Frame**: Agent transitions to position the value of a strategy/demo call.
5. **No-Flake Close**: Agent confirms the prospect’s commitment to attend and reduces the chance of no-shows.
6. **Commitment Building**: Reinforces prospect buy-in and agreement.

**✍️ Script Example**

```
~ Hi, this is [Agent Name] calling from [Company]. How are you today?
~ The reason for my call is to see if you’re open to a quick chat about [value proposition/solution].
~ Can I ask—are you currently facing challenges with [problem/industry pain point]?
~ I’d love to show you how we’ve helped others by [brief benefit].
~ What works better for you—a call this week or next for a quick walkthrough?

## 🛡️ Objection Handling

**Purpose:** Equip your AI agent with ready-to-use, strategic responses for common objections encountered during calls.

The Objection Handling interface allows you to customize exactly what your agent says when faced with typical pushbacks, questions, or resistance. It helps ensure your AI responds smoothly and keeps conversations on track—no matter the objection.

**🎯 Objection Handling Tactics**

Below is a sample library of objection-response pairs (customize these to fit your scenarios):

| **Objection** | **Response Example** |
|---|---|
| “Not interested” | “Totally understand. A lot of business owners said the same before they saw the real impact of a quick strategy session. If a qualified expert could show you exactly how others are getting results, would you be open to a quick call?” |
| “What is this about?” | “Good question. Based on what I see, your company is similar to others getting [X] value from our solution. I wanted to introduce myself and see if a 10-minute call is worthwhile, just to show you what that looks like—no obligations.” |
| “Send me something.” | “Absolutely! Is email best? I’ll send you a quick overview, and would it make sense to connect for 10 minutes after you had a chance to review?” |
| “We already work with someone” / “We’re happy with our current provider” | “That’s great. Many of our clients started out the same way, but found a different perspective refreshing. If what you’re doing is working, that’s awesome—I’d still love to show you another approach that might unlock even more.” |
| “I don’t have time” | “Of course. That’s why we keep these calls super concise, just 10 minutes, and you’ll be the judge if it’s worth taking further. Should I check next week for a window?” |
| “Too expensive” | “I get it, cost matters. Most find a quick chat actually saves more than it costs, especially after seeing how [real benefit] can directly impact your [team/revenue/efficiency].” |
| “Not a priority” | “Understood—a lot going on! I’ll reach out in a few weeks, or would you prefer I send helpful insights about how we help businesses like yours?” |
| “Need to check with my team/partner” | “Makes perfect sense. Would it help if everyone joined a short call, even just to see if it’s worth a closer look?” |
| “How did you get my info?” | “Great question—your details came from [public site/referral]. We only reach out to those who’ve shown a need for what we offer. If you’d like to be removed, just let me know.” |
| “What exactly do you do?” | “In short, we solve [industry pain point] for teams like yours—giving you qualified appointments and live contacts on autopilot, without extra hiring or overhead. Would a brief call make sense to see if this could work for you?” |

> **Tip:** Tailor the response library for your industry and most frequent objections for even more natural, effective handling.
