## üè∑Ô∏è Call Status Tags

Automatically tag calls in GHL based on call outcomes:

> **Note:** Tags are automatically assigned to each call based on its outcome‚Äîsuch as answered, no answer, or busy. This ensures that every call in GoHighLevel is labeled with the status most relevant to that specific call, making it easy to track, filter, and analyze call results directly within your CRM.
### ‚úÖ Answered Status Tag in GHL
