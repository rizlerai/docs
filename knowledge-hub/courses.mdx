![Course Management Dashboard](/images/knowledge-hub/courses/overview.png)

> **Example:**  
> The Knowledge Hub courses dashboard displays a comprehensive table listing courses such as "Dev Course" (Published, 20% completion) and "test course" (Draft status). The interface includes features like search, entry controls, and action buttons for editing, settings, and deletion.


## 📋 Course Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Basic Course Information

When creating a new course, you'll start with the essential information in a clean, user-friendly form:

![Create Course Form](/images/knowledge-hub/courses/add-course.png)

*The "Create New Course" form showing the course title field with character counter (0/140), course visibility options (Private/Public with lock and globe icons), and the informative "What happens next?" section explaining the workflow after course creation.*

### Step 2:  Course Builder

After creating the basic course information, you'll be taken to the Course Builder, an intuitive interface designed for structuring your course from start to finish. The builder includes four main tabs:

**Course Builder Tabs:**
- **Outline**: Organize and structure your course content
- **Details**: Edit course information, configure settings
- **Comments**: Manage learner discussions and feedback
- **Analytics**: View performance metrics and enrollment insights

## 🗂️ Course Structure Management

The **Outline** tab enables you to visually build your course using a hierarchical structure. You can create and manage categories, lessons, and assessments within a drag-and-drop interface.

- **Course Structure**: Drag-and-drop to reorder all elements at the top level
- **Categories**: Group lessons and assessments into folders (folder icons)
- **Lessons**: Add individual learning modules (document icons)
- **Assessments**: Insert quizzes and tests (question mark icons)

![Course Builder Outline Example](/images/knowledge-hub/courses/course-builder.png)

*The screenshot above shows a typical Course Builder "Outline" tab with a category ("Dev Category") and a lesson ("New Lesson") nested within. Elements can be reordered, edited, or added using plus and reorder buttons. You may see status indicators (such as "Published" for a lesson) and convenient controls for structure management.*

- **Lessons**: Add individual learning modules (document icons)
- **Assessments**: Insert quizzes and tests (question mark icons)


![Course Builder Outline Example](/images/knowledge-hub/courses/add-button-course.png)
<Alert className="my-6">
