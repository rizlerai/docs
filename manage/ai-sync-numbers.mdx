### ✅ Pre-check Functionality

Before purchasing a phone number, I use the Local Preference API's pre-check system to ensure the number and its configuration are valid and ready for use.

**Pre-check for Number Purchase**
- **Number Availability**: Confirms the number is available for purchase from the selected provider.
- **Carrier Compatibility**: Checks if the number meets carrier and campaign requirements.
- **Configuration Validation**: Verifies that all required parameters and settings are correct before proceeding.
- **Error Detection**: Identifies any issues that could prevent successful acquisition or use.

**Testing and Validation**
- **Dry Run**: Simulates the purchase and configuration process without making changes, so I can see if everything will work as expected.
- **Simulation**: Previews how the number will behave in routing and campaign scenarios.
- **Validation Reports**: Provides detailed feedback on any issues or confirms readiness for purchase.

**Why Use Pre-check?**
- **Avoid Failed Purchases**: Prevents buying numbers that won't work for your needs.
- **Saves Time and Money**: Reduces troubleshooting and unnecessary costs.
- **Ensures Compliance**: Makes sure all regulatory and carrier requirements are met before you buy.
- **Confidence in Deployment**: Lets you proceed with number acquisition knowing everything is set up correctly.

## 📤 SMS Sending – “From Number" Routing In Workflow

When sending SMS, the system chooses the **"From"** number using a defined order. Below are the options and fallbacks.

**1️⃣ Same as dial**

The system uses the contact’s **last call or conversation** and picks the **last used number** for that contact. That number is used for sending if it’s still valid (see fallbacks below).

**2️⃣ Assigned user**

The system finds the **user assigned to this contact**, then uses that user’s **assigned number** for sending.

**3️⃣ Select any number**

The user picks a **specific number**; the system uses that dedicated number for sending.

**🛡️ Fallback when the chosen number is not 10DLC linked**

If the number from (1), (2), or (3) does **not** have a 10DLC campaign linked (or isn’t valid):

| 🧭 Fallback | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Area-code match** | System uses the contact’s area code, finds a company number with that area code that is 10DLC linked, and uses it for SMS sending. |
| **Final fallback** | If no area-code match is found, the system picks any 10DLC linked number for the company and uses it for SMS sending. |

**📝 Summary**

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Same as dial** | Last call/conversation → last used number |
| **Assigned user** | User assigned to contact → that user’s number |
| **Select any number** | User-selected dedicated number |
| **Fallback 1** | Chosen number not 10DLC linked → use contact area code + 10DLC linked number |
| **Fallback 2** | No area-code match → use any 10DLC linked number |

# 📥 Incoming SMS Routing Flow

When an incoming SMS is received, the system determines which user should be notified and assigned to the message using this prioritized process:

1. **Check caller in logs (previously dialed?)**
   - The system checks if the sender’s number appears in recent call or conversation logs.
   - **If found**: 
     - The last user who communicated with this number is attached to the message.
     - That user receives an in-app notification for the new SMS.

2. **Not dialed, but contact exists**
   - If the number was not found in logs, but a contact profile exists with that phone number:
     - The system checks if the contact has an assigned user.
     - **If assigned**: The message is attached to that user.

3. **Nothing found yet – check “from” number assignment**
   - Still no user assigned after prior steps:
     - The system checks the number (DID — the number the SMS was received on).
     - If that company number is assigned to a user, the message is assigned to that user.

4. **Final fallback**
   - If no user is found through any prior logic:
     - The message is assigned to the company’s default user (such as the company owner or admin).

**📊 Flow Summary**

| Step | Condition                                  | Action                                                                 |
|------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Caller in logs (previously dialed)         | Attach to last conversation user; that user gets in-app notifications  |
| 2    | Contact exists, not in logs                | Assign to contact’s assigned user (if any)                             |
| 3    | Still no user                              | Check received-on number → assign to user that number is assigned to   |
| 4    | Else                                       | Assign to company user (owner/default)                                 |

> **Note:**  
> This routing process ensures that incoming messages are assigned to the most contextually relevant user, helping maintain continuity and quick response for each conversation.
