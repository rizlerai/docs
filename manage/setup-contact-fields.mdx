## 🔗 Fields Mapping

You can map your contact fields to external platforms such as GoHighLevel (GHL) for seamless integration and data synchronization. This is especially useful when your CRM or dialer platform requires the AI or campaign tools to know exactly which contact properties to use during calls, automation, or reporting.

### 🗺️ Field Mapping Interface Overview

The Field Mapping interface allows you to align your internal contact fields with their corresponding fields in external platforms such as GoHighLevel (GHL). This ensures seamless data flow, enables automation, supports AI token mapping, and enriches personalization.

This expanded mapping table reflects the increased flexibility for custom and system fields as visible in the updated Field Mapping modal. Use the "Map to GHL Field" dropdown to assign or search for the correct GHL field, and create any missing custom fields in your CRM as needed.


> **Tip:** Use the "Map to GHL Field" dropdown next to each internal field to select the most appropriate external property. If the target field does not exist in GHL, create a new custom field in your CRM first and then map it.

**Mapping Options:**
- **Dropdown Select:** Choose the right external field for each of your internal data fields from a dropdown menu.
- **Search/Filter:** Instantly find your external fields using a search or filter bar.
- **Remove Mapping:** Remove unnecessary mapping by clicking the "X" button next to a field.
- **Multi-Field Support:** Map multiple or custom internal fields to suitable external fields as needed, including GHL Location.

**Required Fields:**
- Some fields, like `GHL Location`, `Phone Number`, and `First Name`, are often mandatory for both inbound and outbound calling or syncing workflows. Ensure these are mapped to guarantee smooth operation.

**Actions:**
- **Cancel:** Exit the mapping modal without saving any changes.
- **Save:** Save, apply, and sync all your field mappings with the external system.

  **Why Use Field Mapping?**  
  Field mapping guarantees that the right data is always available for campaigns, contact syncing, automation, and personalization. Only mapped fields are accessible to AI and workflows such as inbound calls, campaign tokens, and integration reporting. Including GHL Location mapping ensures your contacts connect with the right account context across platforms.
