The Pipeline module helps you organize your business processes by creating pipelines with multiple stages. Each pipeline represents a workflow, and each stage represents a step in that workflow. Stages appear as columns on your board, allowing you to visualize and manage your processes. This system makes it easier to track progress through different stages of your business operations.

## 🗂️ Overview

/>

The Pipeline board view displays your selected pipeline's stages as columns, with contact cards that can be moved between stages to track progress through your business workflow.

## ✨ Main Features

### 🗃️ Pipeline Board View

When you open the Pipeline page and select a pipeline, you see a visual board that displays the stages of your selected pipeline as columns.

**What you see:**

- Multiple columns displayed horizontally across your screen
- Each column represents one stage from your pipeline
- Each column shows a header with:
  - The stage name at the top
  - A number badge showing the count of contacts in that stage
  - A dollar amount showing the total opportunity value for that stage
- Contact cards displayed within each column representing contacts at that stage

**How it works:**

- When you select a pipeline from the dropdown, the board shows only the stages belonging to that pipeline
- Each column is a separate stage
- You can scroll up and down within each column
- Each column is scrollable independently
- The columns appear in the order you set when creating or editing the pipeline
- Contact cards can be dragged and dropped between columns to move contacts through stages

### 🧾 Contact Cards
