## 🎯 What Is the Pipeline Module?

The Pipeline Module allows you to design, monitor, and adjust your business processes with ease.

**🔗 The Concept of a Pipeline**

A pipeline is a full sequence of steps or phases representing a business process. For example:

- A sales pipeline: "Sales Process"
- A project pipeline: "Project Delivery"
- An onboarding pipeline: "Customer Onboarding"

Each pipeline offers a visual representation of all steps required to take an item from beginning to completion.

**🏷️ Defining Stages**

Stages are the key phases within your pipeline. Think of them as columns, each reflecting a stage in your workflow. Typical stage examples in a sales pipeline:

- New Lead
- Contacted
- Proposal Sent
- Closed

Each stage helps you categorize and track items according to their current status.

**🛠️ How the Pipeline Module Functions**

1. **Create a pipeline** – Give your workflow a descriptive name.
2. **Add stages** – Name each stage clearly to represent its function within your process.
3. **Visual Board** – Your pipeline and its stages are displayed in a Kanban-style board, making it simple to visualize progression and spot bottlenecks.

**🚦 Getting Started**

**🔓 Accessing the Module**

1. Go to the Pipeline section from your main navigation menu.
2. The page opens with the core Pipeline interface, showing several key controls at the top.

**👁️ What You’ll See**

The Pipeline page layout features:

- **Pipeline Management** – manage, create, and edit your pipelines.
- **Pipeline Selector Dropdown** – switch between different pipelines.
- **SOPs Button** – read standards and best practices.
- **Visual Board or Message** – Displays your active pipelines, or “No Pipeline Created” if none exist.

## ➕ How to Create a Pipeline

Follow these steps to add a new pipeline to your system:

#### 1️⃣ Open Pipeline Management

- Click **Pipeline Management** (top left).
- A list of all current pipelines will appear.

#### 2️⃣ Start a New Pipeline

- In the Pipeline Management window, click **+ Add Pipeline** (top right).
- This opens the pipeline creation form.

/>

#### 3️⃣ Specify Pipeline Name

- Fill in the **Pipeline Name** with a clear, descriptive title.
- Required field (indicated by *).
- Examples: “Sales Funnel”, “Product Development”, “Onboarding”.

#### 4️⃣ Add, Remove, or Edit Stages

- The form starts with four default stages:
  - New Lead

- **Add:** Click **Add Stage** at the top of the stages section.

#### 6️⃣ Reorder Stages

- Drag stages by the handle (horizontal lines left of the name).
- Drop them in your preferred order; this defines their display left-to-right.

#### 7️⃣ Finalize and Save

- Double-check your stage names and order.
- Click **Save Pipeline** (bottom right).
- You’ll get a confirmation and your pipeline will display on the board.

## 🔧 Managing Pipeline Stages (For New and Existing Pipelines)

3. The board updates instantly to show the corresponding stages.

**Display Details**

- The newest pipeline is pre-selected when you enter the page.
- All pipelines are listed by name.
- Selected pipeline’s stages appear as interactive columns.

## 👤 Contact Details

When you click a contact (card) on the pipeline board, a **Contact Details** panel or window opens. Here you can view and manage the contact’s information, notes, appointments, and activity log.

### 📋 Contact Details Tab

The Contact Details view shows the contact’s core information—name, phone, email, company, and any custom fields—so you can quickly see who they are and how to reach them.

<img
  src="/images/pipeline/contact-details.png"
  alt="Pipeline - Contact Details"
  className="rounded-lg border shadow-sm"
/>

- Use this tab to **view or edit** the contact’s profile.
- Fields update when you save; changes are reflected across the pipeline.

### 📝 Notes Tab

The Notes tab lets you add and view notes for this contact. Keep context, follow-up reminders, and conversation summaries in one place.

<img
  src="/images/pipeline/notes.png"

  className="rounded-lg border shadow-sm"
/>

- **Add a note** – Enter text and save; the note is attached to the contact.
- **View history** – All notes appear in order so you can see the full context.
- Notes help the team stay aligned when moving contacts through pipeline stages.

### 📅 Appointment Tab

## 📚 SOPs: Standard Operating Procedures

<img

  alt="Pipeline Module - SOPs Window Screenshot"
  className="rounded-lg border shadow-sm"
/>


The **SOPs** (Standard Operating Procedures) button provides instant access to a detailed step-by-step reference covering every core aspect of the Pipeline Module.


1. **Purpose & Scope**  
   _This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the systematic approach for creating, managing, and utilizing pipeline structures within the system to organize and track workflow processes through a visual Kanban board interface._  
   
   _This procedure applies to all authorized users who require access to the Pipeline Management Module for organizing business processes, sales workflows, or project management activities._

2. **Definitions & Terminology**  
   - **Pipeline:** A structured workflow container that organizes processes into sequential stages  
   - **Stage:** A distinct phase within a pipeline representing a specific step in the workflow process  
   - **Kanban Board:** A visual representation displaying pipeline stages as columns with associated items  
   - **Sorting Order:** The sequential arrangement of stages determining workflow progression

3. **Prerequisites & Access Requirements**  
   - Valid user account with appropriate system permissions  
   - Access to the Pipeline Management Module  
   - Understanding of workflow processes to be implemented  

4. **Procedure: Pipeline Creation**

   **4.1 Initial Setup**

   **4.2 Stage Configuration**

   **4.3 Finalization**


5. **Procedure: Pipeline Modification**  
   **5.1 Accessing Edit Mode**

   **5.2 Modification Operations**

   **5.3 Saving Modifications**

6. **Procedure: Pipeline Deletion**  
   1. Access the Pipeline Management interface.  
   2. Identify the pipeline you wish to remove.  
   3. Click the "Delete" icon associated with the desired pipeline.  
   4. Review the system-generated confirmation dialog carefully.  
   5. Confirm deletion by selecting "OK", or cancel the operation if you do not intend to delete.  

   > **Important:** Pipeline deletion is irreversible. Ensure no active workflows depend on the pipeline before proceeding.

7. **Procedure: Pipeline Selection & Navigation**  
   1. Locate the pipeline selection dropdown menu in the header section.  
   2. Click the dropdown and select the desired pipeline from the available options.  
   3. Upon selection, the system will automatically display the Kanban board for the chosen pipeline, rendering all associated stages.  
   4. Each stage will appear as an independent column within the Kanban interface.  
   5. To switch views, simply repeat the selection process to navigate between different pipelines.

8. **Procedure: Stage Management**

   **8.1 Adding Stages**  

   **8.2 Removing Stages**  

   **8.3 Reordering Stages**  


9. **Kanban Board Interface & Navigation**

   **9.1 Kanban Board Interface**

   **9.2 Navigation & Interaction**

10. **Critical Requirements & Constraints**

- **Minimum Stage Requirement:** Every pipeline must always contain at least one active stage; deletion of the last remaining stage is not permitted.
- **Stage Sequence:** The order in which stages are arranged determines the workflow's progression. Ensure stages are sorted logically to accurately reflect your process.
- **Pipeline Independence:** The system supports multiple pipelines, each operating independently—changes to one pipeline will not impact others.
- **Data Integrity:** Deleting a pipeline will permanently erase all its configuration and stage data. This action is irreversible.
- **Access Control:** Only users with the appropriate permissions, as set by system administrators, can modify pipeline structures or settings.

11. **Best Practices**

- **Use Clear, Standardized Naming**  

- **Regularly Review Configurations**  

- **Maintain Consistent Stage Names**  


- **Document Pipeline Purpose & Stages**  

- **Test Before Production**  


Each section is collapsible—click its header to expand or collapse details, making it easy to focus on the topic you need.
