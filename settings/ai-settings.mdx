# 🌎 Use Number For Local Presence

Leverage local presence to improve answer rates and reach by automatically selecting an outgoing number that matches the area code of the person being called.

Local presence ensures calls appear to come from a local number, increasing trust and the likelihood contacts will answer. 

#### ⚙️ How to Configure

1. Click the **Edit** button on the "Use Number For Local Presence" card (as shown above)
2. Choose which of your available numbers the AI should use for each area code or region
3. You can assign multiple numbers to cover different locations
4. Optionally, set specific rules for fallback behavior if no matching local number is available (e.g. default to main number)

_Local presence settings help optimize answer rates and support tailored outreach across different geographies._

> **Note:** In AI Settings, a new tab named **"Use Number For Local Presence"** has been added with two options: **"All"** and **"Unassigned"** (by default, "All" is selected). When you click the **Set** button in this tab, a modal titled **"Set Use Number For Local Presence"** opens, where you can select between the same two values from a dropdown. After changing the value and clicking **Save changes**, the selected value is updated and reflected in the tab. This lets you easily control which numbers are used for local presence through a simple, clear interface.
