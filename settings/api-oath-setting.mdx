## 🔐 API OAuth Configuration

![Overview of API OAuth settings](/images/settings/api-oauth/overview.png)

Manage your OAuth clients and personal access tokens to securely authenticate your applications with the API.

### 🏗️ OAuth Client Management

Create and manage OAuth clients to enable secure API access for your applications. OAuth clients allow you to:

- Generate Client ID and Client Secret for authentication
- Configure redirect URIs for authorization callbacks
- Set up confidential clients for server-side applications

### 🔑 Personal Access Tokens

Create personal access tokens for simpler API authentication without going through the full OAuth flow. Personal access tokens are ideal for:

- Personal use and testing
- Server-to-server communication
- Quick API access without OAuth complexity

<Note>
For detailed information about OAuth setup, creating clients, generating tokens, and understanding the complete OAuth flow, please refer to the [API Reference Introduction](/api-reference/introduction).
