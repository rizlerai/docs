A 10DLC Brand is your business's verified digital identity within the messaging ecosystem. Think of it as your "business license" for professional SMS messaging. It represents:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Business Identity" icon="building">
    Your legal company information, cross-verified with state business registries and federal databases
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trust Score" icon="star">
    Carrier-verified reputation (0-100 scale) affecting message deliverability, sending volume limits, and filtering bypass
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compliance Profile" icon="shield">
    Regulatory standing ensuring adherence to TCPA, CAN-SPAM, and carrier-specific messaging guidelines
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Why Brand Registration Matters:** Unregistered messaging can result in 70%+ delivery failures, automatic spam filtering, and potential number blocking. Registered brands see 95%+ delivery rates and can send up to 100,000+ messages daily.
