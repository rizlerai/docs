# 10DLC Brand Registration & Management

Establish your business identity for compliant Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging by registering and managing your 10DLC brand with wireless carriers. Your brand serves as the foundation for all messaging campaigns, ensuring trust, deliverability, and regulatory compliance.

The 10DLC (10-Digit Long Code) system was implemented by US wireless carriers in 2021 to combat spam and improve message delivery rates. Unlike shortcodes that cost thousands monthly, 10DLC provides enterprise-grade messaging capabilities using standard phone numbers while maintaining carrier-grade deliverability and compliance.
