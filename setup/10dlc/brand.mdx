# 10DLC Brand Registration & Management

Establish your business identity for compliant Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging by registering and managing your 10DLC brand with wireless carriers. Your brand serves as the foundation for all messaging campaigns, ensuring trust, deliverability, and regulatory compliance.

The 10DLC (10-Digit Long Code) system was implemented by US wireless carriers in 2021 to combat spam and improve message delivery rates. Unlike shortcodes that cost thousands monthly, 10DLC provides enterprise-grade messaging capabilities using standard phone numbers while maintaining carrier-grade deliverability and compliance.

## What is a 10DLC Brand?

A 10DLC Brand is your business's verified digital identity within the messaging ecosystem. Think of it as your "business license" for professional SMS messaging. It represents:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Business Identity" icon="building">
    Your legal company information, cross-verified with state business registries and federal databases
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trust Score" icon="star">
    Carrier-verified reputation (0-100 scale) affecting message deliverability, sending volume limits, and filtering bypass
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compliance Profile" icon="shield">
    Regulatory standing ensuring adherence to TCPA, CAN-SPAM, and carrier-specific messaging guidelines
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Why Brand Registration Matters:** Unregistered messaging can result in 70%+ delivery failures, automatic spam filtering, and potential number blocking. Registered brands see 95%+ delivery rates and can send up to 100,000+ messages daily.

## Complete Registration Workflow

### Brand Registration Process

The brand registration follows a systematic approach designed by wireless carriers to ensure only legitimate businesses can send high-volume messages:

1. **Business Type Selection** - Choose your entity type (Corporation, Partnership, Sole Proprietorship, Non-Profit)
2. **Company Information** - Provide legal business details and contact information
3. **Address Details** - Submit physical and mailing addresses (verified against postal databases)
4. **Business Details** - Add website, industry, and online presence information
5. **Documentation Upload** - Submit required verification documents (processed within 24 hours)
6. **Review & Approval** - Carrier review and verification process (automated + manual review)
7. **Brand Activation** - Begin creating campaigns with your verified brand and assigned trust score
