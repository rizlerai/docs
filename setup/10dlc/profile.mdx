Create and manage your business profiles for compliant Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging across both Plivo and Twilio providers. Your 10DLC profile serves as the foundation for all messaging operations, ensuring regulatory compliance and optimal deliverability.


### 📊 Dashboard Overview

The 10DLC Profile dashboard gives you a clear, tabular view of all your business profiles and their compliance status. Below is a representative screenshot of the dashboard interface:


 **Profile Table Columns:**
- **Profile Alias**: Internal friendly name for your profile (e.g., "Company MainProfile", "Demo Test")
- **Company Name**: Your business's legal name (must match registration)
- **Customer Type**: Select between "DIRECT" (registered business) or "RESELLER"
- **Entity Type**: Legal structure, such as "PRIVATE", "GOVERNMENT", etc.
- **Industry**: Select the industry classification for your business (e.g., "PROFESSIONAL")
- **Rizz CMS Status**: Shows CMS (Campaign Management System) integration or link status for Rizz (toggle/indicator)
- **Created At**: Date and time the profile was created
- **Action**: Options to edit or delete a profile (with confirmation)

 **Twilio Status Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Active**/**Approved**: Profile active and messaging enabled
- 🟡 **Pending**: Awaiting review by carrier
- 🟠 **In Review**: Profile is under carrier examination
- 🔴 **Twilio Rejected**: Carrier denied the profile—review the provided feedback before resubmitting
- ⚫ **Disabled**: Profile deactivated; messaging blocked

_Note: Use the "Add Profile" button to create a new 10DLC profile. Use the red "Cancel" button in Actions to remove the draft profile before completion._

For complete transparency, the dashboard also lists the total number of profiles and supports sorting by any field.
