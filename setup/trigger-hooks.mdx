Trigger Hooks provide a powerful automation framework that executes custom actions when specific events occur in your AI Sync system. Unlike webhooks that send data to external endpoints, trigger hooks perform internal actions and workflows within your AI Sync environment.
 

## üîÑ Trigger Hook Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event Detection">
    System monitors for specified events (calls, agent actions, campaigns)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Condition Evaluation">
    Trigger conditions are evaluated against event data and context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hook Execution">
    Qualifying events trigger the configured hook actions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Action Processing">
    Multiple actions can be executed sequentially or in parallel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Result Logging">
    Execution results and outcomes are logged for monitoring
  </Step>
</Steps>
