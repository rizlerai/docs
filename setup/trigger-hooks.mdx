# Trigger Hooks

Set up automated triggers and hooks to create sophisticated workflows and integrations within your AI Sync system.

## Overview

Trigger hooks allow you to automate actions based on specific events or conditions in your system. Unlike webhooks that send data to external endpoints, trigger hooks execute predefined actions within AI Sync or connected systems.

## Types of Trigger Hooks

### Event-Based Triggers

Automatically execute actions when specific events occur:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Call Triggers" icon="phone">
    Execute actions based on call events like start, end, transfer, or specific call outcomes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Triggers" icon="robot">
    Trigger actions when agents are created, modified, or when their status changes
  </Card>
  <Card title="System Triggers" icon="gear">
    Respond to system events like errors, maintenance, or performance thresholds
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Triggers" icon="code">
    Create custom triggers based on specific business logic or external data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Condition-Based Triggers

Execute actions when certain conditions are met:

- **Time-based**: Schedule actions at specific times or intervals
- **Data-based**: Trigger when data values reach certain thresholds
- **Performance-based**: Execute when performance metrics meet criteria
- **User-based**: Trigger actions based on user behavior or attributes

## Setting Up Trigger Hooks

### Creating a New Trigger Hook

1. **Navigate to Setup > Trigger Hooks**
2. **Click "Create Trigger Hook"**
3. **Configure the trigger:**
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the trigger
   - **Event/Condition**: What activates the trigger
   - **Actions**: What happens when triggered
   - **Filters**: Optional conditions to refine trigger activation

### Trigger Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the Trigger Event">
    Select the event or condition that will activate the hook
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Conditions">
    Add filters and conditions to refine when the trigger activates
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Actions">
    Define what actions should be executed when triggered
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and Activate">
    Test the trigger and activate it for live use
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available Actions

### Internal Actions

Actions that execute within the AI Sync system:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Management">
    - Update agent configurations
    - Change agent status or availability
    - Modify agent prompts or responses
    - Assign agents to different campaigns
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Call Management">
    - Transfer calls to specific agents
    - End calls automatically
    - Schedule callback appointments
    - Update call dispositions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Management">
    - Update contact information
    - Add tags or notes to records
    - Create or update PowerLists
    - Log custom events
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Notifications">
    - Send email notifications
    - Create system alerts
    - Generate reports
    - Update dashboards
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### External Actions

Actions that interact with external systems:

- **API Calls**: Send data to external APIs
- **Database Updates**: Update external databases
- **File Operations**: Create or modify files
- **Third-party Integrations**: Trigger actions in CRM, marketing tools, etc.

## Trigger Examples

### Example 1: Call Quality Monitoring

```yaml
Trigger: Call Ended
Conditions: 
  - Call duration < 30 seconds
  - Call status = "disconnected"
Actions:
  - Tag contact as "short_call"
  - Send alert to supervisor
  - Schedule follow-up call
```

### Example 2: Lead Qualification

```yaml
Trigger: Information Collected
Conditions:
  - Budget > $10,000
  - Timeline = "immediate"
Actions:
  - Transfer to senior sales agent
  - Update lead score
  - Send notification to sales manager
```

### Example 3: Performance Monitoring

```yaml
Trigger: Agent Performance
Conditions:
  - Call success rate < 20%
  - Time period = last 2 hours
Actions:
  - Pause agent campaigns
  - Send training reminder
  - Notify team lead
```

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

Use advanced conditional logic in your triggers:

```javascript
// Example: Complex condition evaluation
if (call.duration > 60 && call.sentiment === "positive") {
  // High-value lead actions
  actions.updateLeadScore(contact.id, "+50");
  actions.scheduleFollowUp(contact.id, "2 days");
} else if (call.sentiment === "negative") {
  // Recovery actions
  actions.sendApologyEmail(contact.id);
  actions.scheduleManagerCall(contact.id);
}
```

### Chained Triggers

Create sequences of triggers that execute in order:

1. **Primary Trigger**: Initial event occurs
2. **Secondary Trigger**: Activated by primary trigger action
3. **Tertiary Trigger**: Activated by secondary trigger action

### Scheduled Triggers

Set up time-based triggers for regular maintenance or updates:

- **Daily**: Performance reports, data cleanup
- **Weekly**: Agent performance reviews, campaign optimization
- **Monthly**: Billing updates, system maintenance
- **Custom**: Specific business schedules

## Testing and Debugging

### Test Mode

Use test mode to verify trigger behavior without affecting live data:

<Tip>
  Enable test mode to simulate trigger events and verify actions without executing them
</Tip>

### Debugging Tools

- **Execution Logs**: View detailed logs of trigger executions
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor and resolve trigger failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyze trigger performance and optimization opportunities

### Common Issues

<Warning>
  **Infinite Loops**: Ensure triggers don't create circular execution patterns
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Performance Impact**: Monitor resource usage of complex triggers
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

- **Keep it Simple**: Start with basic triggers and add complexity gradually
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test triggers before deploying to production
- **Monitor Performance**: Regular review trigger performance and efficiency
- **Document Changes**: Maintain clear documentation of trigger logic

### Optimization Tips

- **Use Filters Effectively**: Minimize unnecessary trigger executions
- **Batch Operations**: Group similar actions for better performance
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and fallback actions
- **Regular Maintenance**: Review and update triggers regularly

## Management and Monitoring

### Trigger Dashboard

Monitor all your trigger hooks from a central dashboard:

- **Active Triggers**: View all currently active triggers
- **Execution History**: Track trigger execution frequency and success rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor trigger performance and resource usage
- **Error Reports**: Identify and resolve trigger issues

### Maintenance

- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review trigger relevance and performance
- **Updates**: Keep triggers updated with changing business requirements
- **Cleanup**: Remove obsolete or unused triggers
- **Optimization**: Continuously optimize trigger performance
