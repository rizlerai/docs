# ⚡ Trigger Hooks

Trigger Hooks provide a powerful automation framework that executes custom actions when specific events occur in your AI Sync system. Unlike webhooks that send data to external endpoints, trigger hooks perform internal actions and workflows within your AI Sync environment.
 

## 🔄 Trigger Hook Workflow

  <Step title="Hook Execution">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Result Logging">
