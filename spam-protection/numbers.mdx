  **What are Spam Protected Numbers?**
  
  These are phone numbers that are continuously monitored for spam reputation, carrier compliance, and deliverability status. The system helps prevent your numbers from being flagged or blocked by carriers.

## 🔄 Workflow

The spam protection system follows a comprehensive monitoring and management workflow:

#### 🚨 Option 1: Flag by 1 Carrier (Most Sensitive)

**Example:** Your number is flagged the moment any carrier (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc.) reports it as spam.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fastest possible detection—instant flagging
- ✅ Maximum caution for strict compliance
- ✅ Good for protecting your brand reputation

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ May result in more false positives
- ⚠️ Might flag due to isolated carrier mistakes

**Recommended For:**
- Businesses prioritizing reputation above all
- Low-volume or sensitive callers
- Compliance-heavy industries

---

#### ⭐ Option 2: Flag by 2 Carriers (Recommended - Default)

**Example:** Your number is only marked "Flagged" when both AT&T AND T-Mobile (or any 2 carriers) report it as spam

**Pros:**
- ✅ Reduces false positives significantly
- ✅ More accurate spam detection
- ✅ Balanced approach for most businesses
- ✅ Set as default for optimal results

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Slightly slower detection than Option 1

**Recommended For:**
- Most businesses (Default choice)
- Companies with moderate call volumes
- Businesses wanting balance between accuracy and speed

---

#### 🛡️ Option 3: Flag by 3 Carriers (Least Sensitive)

**Example:** Your number is only flagged when AT&T, T-Mobile, AND Verizon (or any 3 carriers) all report it as spam

**Pros:**
- ✅ Almost no false positives
- ✅ Very high confidence in spam detection
- ✅ Won't trigger on isolated incidents

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ May detect spam issues later
- ⚠️ Your number might already have reputation damage before flagging
