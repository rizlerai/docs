# 📋 Execution Logs Module

> **Your central hub for monitoring and analyzing workflow activity—see every run, filter by date or status, and drill into step-by-step details.**

The Execution Logs module records and displays every time a workflow runs in your system. Use it to see what ran, when it ran, whether it succeeded or failed, and exactly which steps were performed. Perfect for troubleshooting, auditing, and understanding how your automations behave.

## 🧾 What is a Workflow Execution?

A **workflow execution** is a single run of a workflow from start to finish. Each time a workflow is triggered (for example, when a contact is created, a tag is added, or an appointment is booked), the system creates one execution record. That record includes:

- **When** it started and finished  
- **What** triggered it  
- **Which** steps ran and their status  
- **Any** errors that occurred  

Think of it as a receipt for each automation run—you can always look back and see what happened.

## ⚙️ How the Module Works

### 📥 Data Loading

1. **First open** — The page loads executions for **today** by default.  
2. **When you change filters** — The table refreshes automatically.  
3. **Pagination** — Default is **10** executions per page.  
4. **Sort order** — Newest first (by creation date).

### 🎛️ Applying Filters

1. **Date range** — For presets, start/end dates are filled automatically and applied right away.  
2. **Custom dates** — Select start and end, then click **Filter**.  
3. **Workflow, Trigger Type, Status** — Apply as soon as you change the dropdown.  
4. **Combined** — All filters work together; use several at once to narrow results.

### 📄 Viewing Execution Details

1. Click **View Details** on any execution.  
2. The system loads full data for that run: basic info, all steps, and any errors.  
3. Everything is shown in one organized modal so you can troubleshoot or audit quickly.
